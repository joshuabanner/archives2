### Evaluation for JOUR389W

PUT YOUR EVALUATION HERE:

I still often struggle with the interface here as it isn't the most accessible. Too often there is a slight mistake which makes the whole thing not work. Though once I got it to work, it went well, providing the people, places and organizations in the story. This could be beneficial if it has a ton of access to archives, and if someone is very comfortable with using GitHub, then they could do a good job at accessing it. Though, its interface can make it rather difficult.
